**CML CI FLOW** :- 

Continuous Machine Learning (CML) is an open-source library for implementing continuous integration & delivery (CI/CD) in machine learning projects. Use it to automate parts of your development workflow, including ML experiments across your project history and monitoring changing datasets.

**Advantage of CML:-**

•	Auto reports for ML experiments:-  Auto-generate reports with metrics and plots in each Git Pull Request.

•	No additional services:-  Build your own ML platform using just GitHub or GitLab and  No additional services or complex setup needed.

•	GitFlow using DVC:- Use GitLab or GitHub to manage ML experiments, track who trained ML models or modified data and when. Codify data and models with DVC instead of pushing to a Git repo.
